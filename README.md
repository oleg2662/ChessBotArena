# Introduction 
Chess-bot Arena is a project where the purpose is to create a framework and libraries to make it easier for software engineering students to create their own first chess-bots and be able to make them play against each other's bots or themselves.

It contains the code itself in the `src` folder and the thesis in the `doc` folder. (Latter only in Hungarian yet.)
